I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Statistics at Stanford University, advised by Professor [Emmanuel Cand√®s](https://candes.su.domains/). Previously, I obtained my PhD degree in Mathematics at the University of Cambridge, advised by Professor [Mihaela van der Schaar](https://www.vanderschaar-lab.com/prof-mihaela-van-der-schaar/). I am also fortunate to work with Professor [Qingyuan Zhao](http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~qz280/) on causal inference.  I am broadly interested in statistics, machine learning and data science. My current research is on developing causal and predictive inference methods beyond the standard assumptions that have concerns in practice.
