I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Statistics at Stanford University, advised by Professor [Emmanuel Cand√®s](https://candes.su.domains/). Previously, I obtained my PhD degree in Mathematics at the University of Cambridge, advised by Professor [Mihaela van der Schaar](https://www.vanderschaar-lab.com/prof-mihaela-van-der-schaar/). I am also fortunate to work with Professor [Qingyuan Zhao](http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~qz280/) on causal inference.



Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
