I have served as a supervisor for courses [Statistics IB](https://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/study/IB/Statistics/), [Principle of Statistics](https://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/study/II/PrinciplesOfStatistics/) and 
{Mathematics of Machine Learning}(http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~rds37/machine_learning.html) during my time at the University of Cambridge.
